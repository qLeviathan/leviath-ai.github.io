# Leviathan AI Website

This repository contains the source code for the Leviathan AI website, showcasing the company's research and technology in Quantum Flux Neural Networks (QFNN).

## Proprietary Technology Notice

While this website provides detailed information about Leviathan AI's QFNN technology, certain implementation details are proprietary and have been intentionally omitted or simplified:

- The specific Hebbian learning implementation that enables training without backpropagation
- The exact formulation of the Phase-Distance Attention mechanism
- The precise energy conservation algorithms that ensure stability
- Detailed convergence proofs and mathematical derivations

These proprietary elements represent Leviathan AI's core intellectual property and competitive advantage in the field of physics-inspired neural networks.

## Website Structure

The website consists of the following pages:

- **Homepage** (`index.html`): Main landing page with an overview of Leviathan AI, featuring sections for research, technology, about, and contact.
- **Technology** (`leviathan-technology.html`): Detailed explanation of the Quantum Flux Neural Network architecture, core components, computational advantages, and applications.
- **Quantum Computing Implementation** (`quantum-computing-implementation.html`): Information about implementing QFNN on quantum computing platforms.
- **Reality Engine Pathway** (`reality-engine-pathway.html`): Details about the Reality Engine, a physics-based simulation environment built on QFNN principles.
- **Research** (`leviathan-research.html`): Showcases the company's research papers and findings.

## Features

- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Interactive elements with smooth animations
- Quantum particle simulation background on the homepage
- Detailed technical diagrams and mathematical formulas
- Consistent dark blue and teal color scheme across all pages

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- No external libraries or frameworks

## Deployment

The website is deployed using GitHub Pages. To deploy:

1. Ensure all files are committed to the repository
2. Go to the repository settings on GitHub
3. Navigate to the "Pages" section
4. Select the branch to deploy (usually `main` or `master`)
5. The site will be available at `https://qleviathan.github.io/leviath-ai.github.io/`

## Local Development

To run the website locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open any of the HTML files in a web browser

No build process or server is required as this is a static website.

## File Organization

- HTML files are in the root directory
- Images are stored in the `images/` directory
- No separate CSS or JavaScript files (styles and scripts are embedded in the HTML files)
